# Mongodb
Some codes about Mongodb
The bat feil tell us how to use Mongodb to manage the data base
The "db.DatabaseName.insert({"title","db"})" means we add a data in the Database
The "db.DataName.find()" means we can find all the datas in the Database
The "db.DataName.update({"title":"orginName"},{$set:{"title":"updatedName"}})" means we changed the title's name
The "db.DataName.remove({"title":"name"})"means we remove a data in the Database
All of them were handled by CMD,if you fell trouble you can donwload a software named "Rockmongo" 
I am sorry to mistake the title name in this article ,the title name is not "Mogondb" but "Mongodb"
